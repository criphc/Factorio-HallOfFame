# There is still a bug in Factorio 1.1.1

Unfortunately this mod will not yet work by simpling downloading it through the in-game mod portal, or simply copying the zip file into your mods folder. So to temporarily view the Hall of Fame in the current version of the game (1.1.1) you will need to:

- Download this mod (from here)
- Go to your Factorio folder (usually this is at `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Factorio` or `%appdata%/Factorio`)
- Unzip the mod
- Ensure the structure is as follows: 

```
Factorio 
    config
    mods
        modlist.json
        HallOfFame_1.0.0
            locale
            menu-simulations
            control.lua
            etc ...
        other mods...
    saves
    ...
```

- Start Factorio and enjoy the beautiful bases!

# Hall of Fame - Menu Simulations

Factorio has a rich history of amazing creations, from highly optimized builds to beautiful and chaotic spaghetti. With the addition of the Menu Simulations in Factorio 1.1 it is time that we start a **Hall of Fame** to showcase these amazing creations. This is to commemorate the skilled and dedicated community and inspire even greater builds!

Therefore, if you install this mod then this Hall of Fame will occasionally appear behind your main menu, showcasing the graceful movement of full belts, speeding robots and some rumbling rockets. If you want to see a sneak of how it looks like in action you can view this [release trailer](https://youtu.be/zERZh224IkI) on YouTube.

You can set how long each base will play in the mod settings, but it starts with a default play time of 2 minutes so that you have time to investigate the beautiful bases. By default vanilla simulations are turned off by default with a mod setting, but it's advised to turn it back on after you enjoyed the Hall of Fame.

### Expanding the Hall of Fame
The current Hall of Fame list is not complete, and there are still a lot of amazing bases that could be added. I have a few in mind that will be added soon. If you have any suggestions to new additions into the Hall of Fame, please mention it in the discussion. 


### Disclaimer
I did not build any of the bases showcased. I'm simply compiling a list of  memorable bases that other people built which are typically published on Reddit. If you do not like your base being showcased please let me know :)
