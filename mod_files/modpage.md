# Hall of Fame - Menu Simulations

Factorio has a rich history of amazing creations, from highly optimized builds to beautiful and chaotic spaghetti. With the addition of the Menu Simulations in Factorio 1.1 it is time that we start a **Hall of Fame** to showcase these amazing creations. This is to commemorate the skilled and dedicated community and inspire even greater builds!

Therefore, if you install this mod then this Hall of Fame will occasionally appear behind your main menu, showcasing the graceful movement of full belts, speeding robots and some rumbling rockets. They will run almost indefinitely, which also makes for an amazing *screensaver*!

And remember, this mod won't effect your UPS at all, since these simulations isn't loaded while you're playing your save.

Check out this trailer accompanied by beautiful Wintergatan music that showcases the mod (click on the image):

I wrote an in-depth [article](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13) about how this base works and incredibly well it is built. Note: the ratios are slightly off because of changes in recipes since Factorio 0.11.

- [Wube: Factorio 1.1 Playtesting](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=535179#p535179).

The showcased outpost is visible in [FFF #364](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-364) where Klonan shows off the new spidertron waypoints.
- [V453000: GridLock](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-236). [*27 March 2018 using Factorio 0.16*]. This base is built by the Wube developer V453000 to be used as a [Roll-Up poster](https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-236-rollup-trio.jpg) for conferences.

Shown is only one of 107 identical, fully contained, modules. At the time it was likely the highest science per minute while maintaining the highest UPS megabase ever built. Built using the editor.

Built in the editor it comprises out of 30 identical 1kSPM blocks to achieve 30kSPM. *Note: the linked Reddit-post only mentions 20kSPM, but a [benchmark](https://factoriobox.1au.us/result/f4caa737-2286-49d2-95a9-ae2cad97b36d) was later run on a 30kSPM version that reached 70 UPS!*

This was likely the first Default Settings Speedrun attempt that used construction bots, where prior speedrunners didn't bother with the extra requirements. Although this specific run wasn't very fast, using construction bots later became World Record strategy.

### Available Settings
There are settings to modify your viewing experience in the mod settings:
- You can set *how long* each base will play in seconds. It starts with a default playtime of 2 minutes so that you have time to investigate the beautiful bases. These bases will run almost **indefinitely**, which means with longer durations it will create a beautiful screensaver.
- *Vanilla simulations* are turned off by default, but it's advised to turn it back on after you enjoyed the Hall of Fame.
- You can turn on *Alt-Mode*, which is off by default.
- The sound of the simulations can be softer or louder using the *Volume Modifier*. Set it to `0` to mute.

### Expanding the Hall of Fame
The current Hall of Fame list is not complete, and there are still a lot of amazing bases that could be added. I have a few in mind that will be added soon. If you have any suggestions to new additions into the Hall of Fame, please mention it in the discussion. 

### Disclaimers
- I did not build any of the bases showcased. I'm simply compiling a list of memorable bases that other people built which are typically published on Reddit, YouTube or the Factorio Forums. If you do not like your base being showcased please let me know. 
- Some bases' functionality might be modified slightly to work better as a menu simulation, while attempting to remain true to the aesthetics.
- If you're using an overhaul mod (like Krastorio or Space Exploration) then some of the simulations will likely not work correctly.
