## Will this effect my in-game UPS?

This mod has zero effect on your UPS.

## Why can I see the edges of the map?

If you have a high resolution screen or a wide screen it's possible that you see the edges of the map. To circumvent this you can enlarge the simulations by zooming in. Go into settings and change the `Zoom Modifier` until the simulation looks good on your screen.

## What settings are available?

There are a few things you can customize on how the simulations play:
- You can set *how long* each base will play in seconds. It starts with a default playtime of 2 minutes so that you have time to investigate the beautiful bases. These bases can run almost **indefinitely**, which means with longer durations it will create a beautiful screensaver.
- You can turn on *Alt-Mode*, which is off by default.
- The volume of the simulations can be adjusted using the *Volume Modifier*. Set it to `0` to mute.
- It's possible to mute the sound-driven simulations using the *Mute Sound-Driven Simulations* setting. These simulations' sounds might be disruptive to your music, and can therefore be specifically muted.
- Different resolution screens will display the simulations at different zoom levels. Adjust the *Zoom Modifier* if it doesn't fit nicely on your screen. Lower values for smaller screens, and higher for bigger screens. Default 1.
- *Vanilla simulations* are turned off by default, but it's advised to turn it back on after you enjoyed the Hall of Fame.
