# Hall of Fame - Menu Simulations

Factorio has a rich history of amazing creations, from highly optimized builds to beautiful and chaotic spaghetti. With the addition of the Menu Simulations in Factorio 1.1 it is time that we start a **Hall of Fame** to showcase these amazing creations. This is to commemorate the skilled and dedicated community and inspire even greater builds!

Therefore, if you install this mod then this Hall of Fame will occationally appear behind your main menu, showcasing the graceful movement of full belts, speeding robots and some rumbling rockets.
