# Hall of Fame - Menu Simulations

Factorio has a rich history of amazing creations, from highly optimized builds to beautiful and chaotic spaghetti. With the addition of the Menu Simulations in Factorio 1.1 it is time that we start a **Hall of Fame** to showcase these amazing creations. This is to commemorate the skilled and dedicated community and hopefully inspire even greater builds!

Therefore, if you install this mod then this Hall of Fame will occasionally appear behind your main menu, showcasing the graceful movement of full belts, speeding robots and some rumbling rockets. They will run almost indefinitely, which also makes for an amazing *screensaver*!

`And remember, this mod won't affect your UPS at all. The simulations arn't even loaded while you're playing.`

Check out this trailer accompanied by beautiful Wintergatan music that showcases the mod (click on the image):

- [DaveMcW: 1 Rocket Defense Per Minute](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/). [*29 June 2015 using Factorio 0.11*]. I wrote an in-depth [article](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13) about how this base works and incredibly well it is built. Note: the ratios are slightly off because of changes in recipes since Factorio 0.11.
- [Xterminator: Send Supporters to Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMcoYkR_qAQ&ab_channel=Xterminator). [*12 September 2017 using Factorio 0.16*] A highly optimized 4 kspm (version equivalent) megabase where he sent his supporters to space in rockets. (Thanks Xterminator for the save!)
- [Zisteau: Meiosis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaFzYF6jJyUIJYXYpCE4UIr3). [*July 2016 to May 2017 using Factorio 0.12 to 0.14*]. The legendary YouTube player [Zisteau](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewxof_QqDdqVdXY1BaDtqQ) builds a large factory based on various isolated cells, similar to cells in a growing organism, that he called [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis). (Thanks Zisteau for the save!)
- [Wube: Factorio 1.1 Playtesting](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=535179#p535179). [*30 January 2020 using Factorio 1.1*] This is the map that the Factorio developers (called Wube) used to playtest Factorio 1.1 during its development. The showcased outpost is visible in [FFF #364](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-364) where Klonan shows off the new spidertron waypoints.
- [Wube: Factorio Trailer 2014](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=4273&p=552560#p552560). [*1 May 2014 using Factorio 0.10*] This is the map which was used for the orginal Factorio trailer in 2014. It was also adapted later to be used for the subsequent trailers in 2016 and 2020.
- [V453000: GridLock](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-236). [*27 March 2018 using Factorio 0.16*]. This base is built by the Wube developer V453000 to be used as a [Roll-Up poster](https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-236-rollup-trio.jpg) for conferences. It was another step towards mastering the way of organically grown factories. *Note: The base was modified slightly to work in Factorio 1.1*.
- [RootNegative: Break The Game](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7ICWbZUDjmER1peO3pQklyKYSjHI3gX). [*2 January 2016 using Factorio 0.12*]. Probably one of biggest bases of the Factorio 0.12 era. Many people were very excited to see the Crusher running with it's sophisticated train unloader, although it's [slightly outdated](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13/#running-the-factory-in-10).
- [KatherineOfSky and Caledorn: Multiplayer World Record 500+](https://youtu.be/c2M7xhE6wKo). [*25 January 2020 using Factorio 0.18*]. This map broke the world record for the most concurrent players on one map and is likely still the defending champion. At its peak they reached 521 concurrent players and had 924 unique players join. (Thanks KatherineOfSky for the save!)
- [NiftyManiac: GreyGoo Mk1](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=204&t=41377). [*16 February 2017 using Factorio 0.14*] Using complex circuitry, in combination with [Recursive Blueprints](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/recursive-blueprints) and a modified [Logistic Train Network](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Optera/LogisticTrainNetwork), this factory expanded autonomously.
- [Drogiwan Cannobi: JOSEF](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-39/) [*May 2021 using Factorio 1.1*] A robust self expanding factory named JOSEF (JOSEF's organically self-expanding factory). This base grew bigger than the self-expanding factory it was based on, namely: GreyGoo.
- [arrow in my gluteus maximus](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=193&t=44499) [*24 April 2017 using Factorio 0.15*] A real time digital clock using only trains and circuits. It's even visible from the map view!

- [SteveTrov: Go Big or Go Home 15 RPM](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/655440/go_big_or_go_home_15_rpm_modular_gigabase/). [*13 April 2017 using Factorio 0.14*]. Likely the fastest vanilla-ish base at the time.
- [SteveTrov: Monolithic Train Megabase 10 kSPM](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/elcl7a/monolithic_10k_train_megabase_google_map_style/). [*7 January 2020 using Factorio 0.18*]. A beautiful and incredibly well designed 10 kSPM megabase using only trains, occasional bots, and no belts. This base has been extensively used for [benchmarking](https://factoriobox.1au.us/results?map=d3c52cb60a225a29051060343c517816ee0f8655a52e1351fbc449da8e9ff0ea&vl=&vh=&sort=time) by the [Technical Factorio](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/) community.

Shown is only one of 107 identical, fully contained, modules. At the time it was likely the highest science per minute while maintaining the highest UPS megabase ever built. Built using the editor.
- [flame_Sla: 30kSPM 60 UPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/comments/ks2xtk/20k_spm_201000spm_belts_v30/). [*7 January 2021 using Factorio 1.1*]. At the time biggest and most UPS efficient base ever built, surpassing [Swolar's base](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/gely3v/20000_science_per_minute_hybrid_modular_megabase/) by 10 kSPM, and in UPS optimization in Factorio 1.1. Built in the editor it comprises out of 30 identical 1kSPM blocks to achieve 30kSPM. *Note: the linked Reddit-post only mentions 20kSPM, but a [benchmark](https://factoriobox.1au.us/result/f4caa737-2286-49d2-95a9-ae2cad97b36d) was later run on a 30kSPM version that reached 70 UPS!*

- [Warger: Speedrun 100% World Record: 5h 26m 46s](https://www.speedrun.com/factorio/run/z5v2l0dm). [*22 January 2022 using Factorio 1.1.53*] World record in completing _all_ achievements in the shortest time possible by Warger who, at the time, dominates this 100% speedrun category.
- [Gotyoke: Tool-Assisted Speedrun (TAS) Any%: 1h 21m 20s](https://github.com/gotyoke/Factorio-AnyPct-TAS). [*27 April 2020 using Factorio 0.18.17*] This is the only known tool-assisted speedrun (meaning the engineer is controlled by a script) that has actually launched a rocket (except for a previous [TAS run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F8PI_VYdV8) by the same player). This is also likely the fastest a rocket has ever been launched in by a single engineer. This is a very unique and epic achievement!
- [Rain9441](https://www.twitch.tv/rain9441): Speedrun Default Settings: 4h 13m 37s. [*3 December 2017 using Factorio 0.15.40*]. This was likely the first Default Settings Speedrun attempt that used construction bots, where prior speedrunners didn't bother with the extra requirements. Although this specific run wasn't very fast, using construction bots later became World Record strategy.
- [Soelless Gaming (P0ober) & JD-Plays: Spaghetti Base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUUT3C2Xevc&list=PLd4gX1UWnrsBkMQf2ZwyfjXLtdtEOOg13&index=85&ab_channel=SoellessGaming).

- [MangledPork Gaming: Living With Biters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZJXS1sQDUzWtvBLn9ZPyUXk). [*February 2015 to June 2016 using Factorio 0.12*]. A unique base where Bentham lived in harmony between the native biters by enabling peaceful mode. Unfortunately, in modern Factorio, this is no longer possible without them destroying your structures. 
- Goose: Burner Inserter Megabase. [*September 2019 using Factorio 0.17*]. A megabase using only burner inserters.
- [PM_ME_DELICIOUS_FOOD: BadBagel](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/jl4gvh/you_guys_love_superspaghetti_so_as_promised_heres/). [*30 October 2020 using Factorio 1.0*]. Chaotic spaghetti base with creative and odd systems. Watch the trains and sushi belts.
- PIrusama: Symbiotic Utopia. [*July 2021 using Factorio 1.1*]. "It's sort of a symbiotic utopia that self-contains pollution. The biters wouldn't call it an utopia but, oh well."

### Expanding the Hall of Fame
The current Hall of Fame list is not complete, and there are still a lot of amazing bases that could be added. If you have any suggestions for new additions to the Hall of Fame, please mention them in the discussion. 

### Disclaimers
- I did not build any of the bases showcased. I'm simply compiling a list of memorable bases that other people built which are typically published on Reddit, YouTube or the Factorio Forums. If you do not like your base being showcased please let me know. 
- Some bases' functionality might be modified slightly to work better as a menu simulation, while attempting to remain true to the aesthetics.
- If you're using an overhaul mod (like Krastorio or Space Exploration) then some of the simulations will likely not work correctly.
